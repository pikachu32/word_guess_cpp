# Word Guessing Game

This is a simple console-based word guessing game implemented in C++. Try to guess the hidden word within a limited number of attempts.

## How to Play

1. Compile and run the `word_guess.cpp` file.
2. Choose a number (1-20) to select a hidden word.
3. The game displays the capital letter X for each letter of the word.
4. Enter letters to guess if they are in the word.
5. Correct guesses reveal letters; incorrect guesses reduce attempts.
6. Continue guessing until you find the word or run out of attempts.

## Controls

- Enter letters to guess.
- You have a limited number of attempts (default: 10).

## Customization

Modify the C++ code to adjust attempts, add words, or customize gameplay.
